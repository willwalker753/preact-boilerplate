            If a user reloads a non index page (or goes directly to it)
                then github will return a 404 page
                because only the index page is hosted, routing is handled by Preact

            So we are hosting a custom 404 page that redirects the user back to the app
                The requested path is sent as a hash, and is handled by the Preact router
